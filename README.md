#**MiniProject Word Wrangler**  

*Overview*  

In this mini-project we will create a simple word game. The game will take an input word and then generate all valid words that can be creat
ed using the letters in the input word. You will then play the game by guessing all of the words. The objective of this mini-project is to w
ork with ordered lists and recursion. While it is possible to write the functions in other ways, we strongly encourage you to follow the spi
rit of the mini-project. The only way to become more comfortable with recursion is to write recursive functions!
We have provided a working GUI and a class to manage the state of the game. You will be responsible for writing several helper functions. Th
ese functions will be used by the provided code in order to build the list of valid words that are composed of letters from the input word.
